# Building

There is currently only one build target - the client. This project relies on CMake as its build toolchain, platform-specific instructions below.

## Windows

CMake + w64devkit/MinGW should work out of the box

## Linux

Please install the following Debian packages to build GLFW:

- libwayland-dev
- wayland-protocols
- pkg-config
- libx11-dev
- libxcursor-dev
- libxinerama-dev
- libxrandr-dev
- libxi-dev
- libgl1-mesa-dev
- libglu1-mesa-dev
- libxkbcommon-dev

Full command: `apt install -y libwayland-dev wayland-protocols pkg-config libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxkbcommon-dev`

Apparently we're less clever than FRVR, we could NEVER be creators...

We tried to negotiate with Brian to work for FRVR and give them every exploit we had for ~$10k (shared across ~10 people)
